Using "binary" [ftp transfer] solved all my problems.
At one time I knew using ASCII results in confusion about control characters
by some transmission protocol but I forgot.  I also should have noticed the
bytes transferred was wrong using ASCII.

My PC Fortran is "Absoft Pro Fortran".  It requires use of the BigEndian
and to deal with 70 Mbytes of input in one read statement it requires use of
the static storage option or raising the stack size limitation in the Linker
options.  Unformatted read is used as well.

If anyone else needs to ingest RAF data into a PC without dealing with special
software only using Fortran, these clues might help.  Of course I would be
more than happy to talk to (or email) with anyone facing these problems.
