# GENPRO

GENPRO is a software package developed at NCAR designed for scientific data
processing. The data files output from this software are written in a
binary format, which came to be known as GENPRO format.

This repository contains all the old GENPRO-I and GENPRO-II code that could be
found around NCAR. In addition it contains software to convert GENPRO-I and
GENPRO-II to netCDF.
