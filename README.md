# GENPRO
GENPRO is a software package developed at NCAR designed for scientific data processing. The data files output from this software are written in a compressed binary format, which came to be known as GENPRO format.

This repository contains all the old GENPRO-I and GENPRO-II code I could find around NCAR. In addition it contains (will contain) software to convert GENPRO-I and GENPRO-II to netCDF.

Documentation of the GENPRO software can be found in the NCAR archives: https://opensky.ucar.edu/islandora/search/GENPRO?type=dismax
