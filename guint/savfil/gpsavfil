#
# NOTE: prior to 6/24/88 usage of GUINT development version:
#
#  Use to save all of the Log files, Flight Decks, Calib source files, or
#
#  The following files are saved to the corresponding MS pathnames:
#
# Logfiles:      /RAF/LOGFILE/<project number>/<flight number>/<year>
# 2D Logfiles:   /RAF/2DLOGFILE/<project number>2D/<flight number>/<year>
# Prod'n Deck:   /RAF/PRODUCTION/<project number>/<year>
# 2D Prod'n:     /RAF/PRODUCTION2D/<project number>2D/<year>
# Flight Decks:  /RAF/FLT_DECKS/<project name>/<project number>/<year>
# 2D Flights:    /RAF/FLT_DECKS/<project name>2D/<project number>/<year>
# Source files:  /RAF/CALIBS/<project number>/<year>
# Summary file:  /RAF/<project no.>SMMRY/<project number>/<year>
# Tape Log file: /RAF/<project no.>TPLOG/<project number>/<year>
#
#
# AFTER 6/24/88 usage of GUINT development version:
#
#  The following files are saved to the corresponding MS pathnames:
#
# Logfile:       /RAF/LOGFILE/<project number>/<flight number>/<year>
# 2D Logfiles:   /RAF/2D_LOGFILES/<project number>/<flight number>/<year>
# Prod'n Deck:   /RAF/PRODUCTION/<project number>/<year>
# 2D Prod'n:     /RAF/2D_PRODUCTION/<project number>/<year>
# Source files:  /RAF/CALIBS/<project number>/<year>
#
#   ...and the following files are grouped in the following order:
#
# Summary, Compflt, Taplog, Segmnts, Adsud, Calcoe, Header, [Termvars,
# Plot1, Plot2,] Flight Decks [,2D Flight Decks, Tdump,] Procssrs,Fltsav,
# Setsav [,Special],Output < w/ assumed CMS filetype of <project number>>
# [,Adsraw <project number>LOG]
# ...and saved to /RAF/GUINT/<project name>/<project number>/<year>
#
#  The Special file is presently constructed manually (via editor) and
# consists of any files not listed above.
# Brackets indicate files that are optional and may not have been used.
# Logfile are to be saved manually as part of Production processing, and
# the remaining files can be saved in one fell swoop using this exec.
