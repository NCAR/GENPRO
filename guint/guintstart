# Usage: GPGUINT <project name> <proj. #> <working path> <version>
#
# -- used to initiate, process, and wind up project processing via Genpro
#
#    It is assumed that this exec is called by a top level Exec created
#    by running the GPSETUP Exec.
#
#   The following files are needed to run correctly:
#
#    CALIBS <prnum> <workdisk> -- list of special processing source
#      files in the form
#
#       GETSRC,&PROJECT,<filename>,<filetype>,<user disk>.
#
#
#  The following files are created here:
#
#    <prname> JOBLOG <workdisk> -- log of jobs submitted
#    <prname> JOBCHK <workdisk> -- summary extract from logfiles
#    <prname> TAPLOG <workdisk> -- production tape log
#    TERMVARS <fltno> <workdisk> -- directives inserted to prevent
#     scaling errors
#
#  Specify the disk mode used for GENPRO 191 or HORTON 191:
# Begin: Project name, project #, user's working disk letter, version
setenv prname  $1
setenv prnum  $2

setenv header  "***************************"
setenv trailer  "**********************************"
# flag for writing explanatory raps before each operation
setenv preamble  "off"
# if not done already, copy needed database files to user's workdisk

#  The entire gpguint structure is being rewritten, it will be implemented
#  using nested while loops instead of the GOTOs required by CMS.
