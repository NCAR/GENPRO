Report #1

Ron Ruth  5 May 1990 (0-881 Sodium Lidar, Dick Friesen)
If a segments file exists and has entries, equivalent entries must exist
in its corresponding summary file.  If not, the program hangs.
Example:
    A preliminary run of GUINT created a segments file for a test flight.
    When the final processor was being set up, all the research flights
     were entered and the test flight deleted.
    When a "continue & save" was issued, GUINT reported one segment length
     for a test flight which didn't appear in the summary file, a message
     appeared telling the user of the (deleted) test flight length asking
     if it was OK.  When the default (OK) response was given, GUINT hung up
     until a ^C (interrupt) was issued.
Program needs to be modified to warn the user of this condition (minimum)
and/or ask user what steps to take (ignore, delete entry from segments file,
add entry to summary file).

GUINT doesn't handle certain difference variables properly.
examples are DFATBFH and DFATFHB
the 'LETVAR= 3[   x, y, z  ], %FOR, DFATBH' portion in CALIB is missing.

It appears that GUINT doesn't save enough files to allow a reprocess, if
one is deemed necessary later.

GUINT saves some flight-related things in its project-related data base.
For example:  Operations and Output Dispositions are selected in the
  miscellaneous menu, saved in the project setup and put into individual
  flight files.  if you restore a project and flight, the "saved" values
  for these operations and dispositions come from the saved project's
  data, not the flight's.
