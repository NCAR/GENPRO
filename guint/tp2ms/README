Tape staging:

o1gptp2ms has old script
o3gptp2ms.f has old FORTRAN file to go with o1gptp2ms
These versions would send a script with multiple 'msimport' statememts as a
batch job which would run on the Cray.  The job would submit a bunch of
'msimport' requests to the MSCP.

The current version runs a script on the local machine.  It submits individual
staging jobs via MIGS instead of via a Cray job (which is discouraged by SCD).
It means more email messages to a user but is much more frugal of resources.

The current version must be verified.  No test has been made of the code since
it was changed.
