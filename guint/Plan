UNICOS GUINT (uguint) conversion plan.   RLR <900913.1200mdt>
                              updated        <901106.1600mst>

Present file structure on the Masscomp for GUINT is as follows:
  /users/raf/source/guint   <--- current COS-JCL version of GUINT
  /users/raf/source/dguint  <--- current COS-JCL version of GUINT modified
                                  module-by-module to UNICOS
  /users/raf/source/uguint  <--- UNICOS version of GUINT assembled in
                                  pieces from .../dguint

We plan to reinstate SCCS on GUINT after the UNICOS coversion is complete.

Steps in GUINT conversion.
1)  Determine which GUINT modules should need no conversion.
  a)  Log flight tapes
1)  Set up HaRP GENPRO processor on the X-MP and acquire a reference data set.
2)  Convert COS-JCL GUINT modules to UNICOS one at a time.  First conversions
     will be from JCL to UNICOS scripts.  There are ____ main areas where
     COS-JCL is submitted to the X-MP:  
  a)  Read raw ADS tapes and descend the data to the MSS
  b)  Acquire ADS header and calibration information from a raw ADS
       data set on the MSS
    .)  user directives -- runs adsraw
    ..) time segments -- runs gtsegs
    ...) both -- in effect, runs each of above options
  c)  Get a sample tape dump of a raw ADS data tape from the MSS
  d)  Build batch processing files
  e)  Run GENPRO to produce processed data sets
  f)  Get a sample tape dump of the processed data set from the MSS
  g)  Archive log files and other pertinent data to the MSS
3)  Convert GUINT modules (which read COS output files) to read newly-formatted
     UNICOS output data.  These modules are in the following areas:
  a)  Interpret results of staging ADS tapes to the MSS
  b)  Interpret results of raw ADS dumps
  c)  Interpret results of GENPRO processing runs
  d)  Interpret results of processed data set dumps from the MSS
  e)  Prepare log files and other pertinent data for archiving on the MSS

ldads/   process ADS header data and time segments files
misc/    miscellaneous GUINT utilities and library files
outdmp/  processed data dump
rawdmp/  acquire raw ADS data dump and ADS header data
savfil/  archive appropriate data on the MSS
scales/  function to prevent scaling errors on output data sets (discouraged)
setup/   start setting up new GUINT processor
submit/  submit GENPRO job to the Cray
taplog/  log final processed data for archival purposes
tharp/   HaRP test directory (COS-JCL version)

Plan for output tape dump (after processing)
make gpoutdmp.f using copied makefile from dguint directory
copy appropriate files needed to run it (summary,  compflt, output).
test run it manually
edit gpoutdmp script to reflect current changes (may also want to include
  some status checking)
test entire operation by manually running gpoutdmp script

NOTE:  must capitalize MSS file name before creating script file

It has become apparent that GUINT in its present form will be difficult to
completely convert to UNICOS in a short amount of time.  Since the Cray Y-MP
has come on board (October 1), we have succeeded in getting the first of three
GUINT sections running.  This section is largely responsible for setting
initial data, for logging and staging flight tapes, for acquiring GENPRO's ADS
header UDs and for getting time segments for all the data sets.

It is now possible to use this portion of GUINT with an unaltered second
section, the section that creates a Cray JCL job file.  It is in a preliminary
form, however, which needs much revision (not to mention conversion to a
UNICOS script).  GUINT has not been updated to include new variables which
are becoming commonplace, e.g., cryogenic hygrometer and CVI.  Once we learn
where to add these new variables, GUINT should be able to handle them, as
well.

Of most concern is the third section.  It is responsible for relieving a
user from doing a lot of busy work.  For example, this section will scan a
returned job log file looking for errors and other problems.  Once the
log file is scanned, it can use the data to create and update a tape log
and to handle data archiving to the MSS.

Since GENPRO will be with us for quite some time (measured in years), Gary,
Celia and I think that some of the tasks that GUINT can perform will save us
a lot of time and effort.  The problem is that, in its present form, GUINT
cannot do many of those jobs.  Celia finds these GUINT capabilities most
useful:
   1)  ability to import tapes/Exabyte cartridges to the SCD MSS
   2)  ability to read the ADS header and generate the GENPRO INPUT UDs
   3)  ability to obtain time segments for each flight
   4)  ability to generate a set of UDs for GENPRO operations
   5)  ability to examine the output log file from each GENPRO production run
   6)  ability to use output log files to generate an output tape log file
To these I would add the ability to check an output log file for obvious
errors.

Because a short-term investment in development should produce a future long-
term benefit, I propose to conduct a 3 man-week study of GUINT (also using
Celia and Gary as resource persons) to determine the best way to update GUINT.
In our short meetings this week, it was apparent that we could not reach any
definite conclusions about what to do.  What I am proposing is to answer the
questions of how much work we should put into GUINT development and exactly
what we want the "new" GUINT to do.  After HaRP processing is underway, I'd
like to spend essentially full RAF time on it to minimize the other
distractions which could delay my work.
