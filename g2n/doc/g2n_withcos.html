# HARP90 files are cos-blocked, so before converting from GENPROII to netCDF
# remove the cos-blocking using code from CISL specific to the platform
# this script is being run on. The aircraft files are in three blocks and
# cosconvert seems to only convert the first block, so the technique I had to
# use was to run "cossplit" to split the aircraft file into three files, 
# then run "cosconvert" on each subfile, then finally use "cat" to combine 
# the three files back into one. Then I could use g2n to convert the
# file to netCDF. E.G.:

# Split the aircraft file into three files
cossplit 1990.876.HRT.RF01

# remove cos-blocking from heac subfile
cosconvert -b T0O1
cosconvert -b T0O2
cosconvert -b T0O3

# combine the three fiels back into one
cat T0O1 T0O2 T0O3 > RF01

# comvert the combined file to netCDF
g2n RF01 RF01.nc
