	<H2>Steps to convert old GENPROII data to netCDF, and to load these
	    old data and projects into CODIAC</H2>


	    <br>
<H3>Convert the GENPROII files to netCDF and archive them to the Mass
Store</H3>
<ol>
    <li> <b>Choose a project</b> that is in GENPROII format to start with.
<p> Access the list of old projects by going to the 
 <a href="http://www.eol.ucar.edu/about/our-organization/raf/data/raf-project-data-archive-catalog">
     RAF Project Data Archive Catalog</a> page. GENPROII projects are between years 1993 and 1983. 
 Open the data catalog link (taplog) and make sure the data is in GENPROII format (Look for "Output format: GENPRO-II" near the top).

 <li> <b>Create a directory to work in </b> 
 <p> under /net/work/Projects/g2n_conversion create a directory for the project, copy everything from /net/work/Projects/g2n_conversion/BLANK into the directory.</p>
 <pre>
	cd /net/work/Projects/g2n_conversion
	mkdir Project
	cp ../BLANK/* Project
 </pre>

<li> <b>Get a list of the GENPROII files</b> 
<p>Go back to the taplog and open the order link (near the bottom of the taplog "Click here to retrieve data file...")
There will be a textbox with a list of mass store files highlight them and copy (You will need to right click and click copy to get around the "Sorry this field
cannot be edited" warning)
</p>

<li><b>Download and convert the files to netCDF</b>

<p>
In the directory you created, create files.txt and paste the list of GENPROII files into it.
run dlconv.pl which will download all of the files in files.txt, convert them to NetCDF and reorder the NetCDF files.<br/>
When it is done running (may take a while) check for ErrorLog.txt, if it exists there was a problem downloading one or more of the GENPROII files. The problems will
be listed in ErrorLog.txt<br/>
Occasionally the file location is wrong in the taplog and you must find it using msls and fix the entry in files.txt and rerun dlconv.pl (it will skip already
downloaded files)
<br /><br />
Syntax notes on files.txt<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each file must be on its own line<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the file name or path does not contain the flight number (\w\w\d\d\w?) ",fltno" should be added to the line<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ex: /RAF/TL0910/G61741,RF01<br />
</p>

<b>To convert the files manually</b>, download each file using <a href="http://www.mss.ucar.edu/dcs4/current-html/msrcp.html">msrcp</a> and use the following steps.
The code is in
 /net/work/bin/converters.
<p>
 Notice that the files you downloaded are cos-blocked. The aircraft files
 are in three or more blocks and cosconvert seems to only convert the first block,
 so the technique I had to use was to run "cossplit" to split the aircraft
 file into three or more files, then run "cosconvert" on each subfile, then finally
 use "cat" to combine the three files back into one. Then I could use g2n
 to convert the  file to netCDF. E.G.:
<pre>
 cossplit 1990.876.HRT.RF01
 cosconvert -b T0O1
 cosconvert -b T0O2
 cosconvert -b T0O3
 cat T0O1 T0O2 T0O3 > RF01
 g2n RF01 RF01.nc
</pre>

 <li>Run "<b>ncplot file.nc</b>" on a few of the  newly created files and make sure
 content looks resonable.
 Also run "<b>ncdump -h file.nc</b>" and check for reasonableness.
 <p>
 <li><b>Create a readme</b> in each working dir stating these steps so that
 future users will know how we did the conversion.
 <p>
 <li><b>Reorder the files (if dlconv.pl was not used)</b> (run "<b>reorder *nc</b>"). This will create s* files which
are the original files, and replace your files with reordered files. <br />
WARNING: running reorder *nc on already reordered files such as those created by dlconv.pl will
result in permissions issues. Run <b>chmod 666 *nc</b> to fix the permissions
<p>
<li>Copy <b>archAC.sh</b> to the /net/work/Projects/g2n_conversion/Project dir (Already done if you copied the files in g2n_conversion/BLANK)<br />
Open archAC.sh and put the the appropriate project number, project year, and uncomment the HRT and or LRT lines as nessesary.<br />
run archAC.sh to archive the .nc files to the mass store (Make sure the files are renamed correctly, dates are reasonable and the mass store directory is correct).
<p>
</ol>

<br>
<H3>Put the project (if necessary) and dataset into codiac</H3>
<p>

 Once you have the data converted to netCDF in
/net/work/Projects/g2n_conversion and you have
 tested them using ncplot and ncdump and archived them to the mss using
 archAC.sh:
<ol>
    <li> <p>See if the project exists in codiac.</b>
 - go to http://data.eol.ucar.edu/codiac/ and look for it
<p>
If it does not exist, then <b>add it</b>. Search through the binders at RAF for it, or if
the project is more recent, search online for project description, AOI and TOI.<br/>
AOI and TOI can be gotten from the NetCDF files. For TOI the renamed NetCDF files will have the start and stop time of each file, look for the
oldest and newest files.<br/>
AOI can be obtained using ncplot and checking the ALAT/ALON variables or by using ncstat.pl located in /net/work/Projects/g2n_conversion/scripts<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;cd to the directory will all of the NetCDF files and run "ncstat.pl ALAT" it will print out the min and max latitude and any error is encounters.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;STRAY VALUES is a common error caused by a large very sharp spike in the variable value (ncplot the file you will see the spike). These files are ignored for the
min/max calculation.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CONSTANT DATA is a more rare error tha occours when the variable value is exactly constant for the entire flight (ie. nav data was not recorded during that flight).
These files are ignored for the min/max calculation<br/>

	>click here</a> for instructions on using ProjSetup.pl to add projects and datasets to CODIAC</b><br/>
(Steps culled from <a

     the project to codiac</a>.)
 <ul>
     <p>You will need to be logged into the Tsunami MySQL database in an xterm
     and have GUImaint up.

     <li>In the GUImaint window, click on Project on the left. You should get a
     blank form. If it is populated, I log out and back in to get a blank one.
     Enter the project info you researched. Reword the description to be past
     tense.

     <li>In the database window:
     <br>> select * from dataset_prefix_project;
     <li>select the next number, e.g. 131 for SPIN (use the acronym, not the full
     name - you only have 15 chars to play with)
     <br>> insert into dataset_prefix_project (dataset_id_prefix,project_id) values (131,"SPIN");
     <li>Link the number to the project description:
     <br>> select * from project where full_name like "Spontaneous%";
     <li>Make sure you only matched ONE project
     <br>> update project set project_id = "SPIN" where full_name like "%Spontaneous%";

     <li>Logout and back in to GUImaint and the project number (131) should appear
     in the Project form.

     <p>Update links to these projects in the 
<a href="http://www.eol.ucar.edu/raf/data_catalog.htm">
RAF Project Data Archive Catalog  
</a>
     <li>Make sure the TapeLog is an xlink in the database
     <br>> select * from xlink where href like "%739%";
     <li>If it's not there, add it by going to the xlinks tab in GUImaint for any
     dataset and adding the link title, purpose, and HREF. I use
     <br>> select * from xlink;
     <br>to see past examples so I can be consistent.
     <li>Then logout and back into GUImaint so the new xlink will show up on the
     project xlinks table. Add the xlink for the project ID. Sometime I can't
     add to a project with no previous xlinks, so I just go to a different
     project and add a line. As long as I put in the project_id for the
     project I want to add (and not the project I am looking at) the line I
     add will "fly away" to the correct project when I post and save.

     <li>Go to http://www.eol.ucar.edu/data and make sure your project is there
     and the xlink works.
 </ul>
<p>
 If it does exist, then compare the info at the top of the taplog file with
 what is in codiac. Let's meet and decide what, if anything, is missing
 from codiac and can be added.

 <li> Use the information in codiac to <a href="http://dmg.eol.ucar.edu/dts/dln"
     target="_top">add the project to the DTS</a>.  
 Check that the project is not already there (click on Project). From the
 dts, click "DLN home" on the left, then click on "Add/Edit Projects", then
 add new. All the info you need should be available in codiac. If you have
 questions, ask.
 <p>
<li> You should then see the project listed under "Project" on the left in
 the DTS. Click on it, then click on "Add New" to add a new dataset. Use a
 previously loaded dataset  of the same type (LRT, HRT, camera, movie, etc)
 for a recent project (HIPPO, PLOWS, etc) as an example of the dataset
 naming connvention. The ingest location will be your dir under /net/work.
 The archive location will be where you put them on the mss. Get the
 dataset prefix from codiac and then just add .001, .002, etc in order for
 each dataset you load. Put me as the internal and source contacts. Put
 yourself as the ingest and load contacts and me as the checker.

<p> Don't forget to add two dataset for each data type: one in netCDF format
 and one in GENPRO. We want to load them as two separate datasets in
 codiac. Make sure the GENPRO dataset is hidden. It is for internal
 tracking use only.
 <p>
<li> Load the dataset as normal and update the dts when you have checked it.
Link the mass store bitfile log (given in the 
 <a
     href="http://www.eol.ucar.edu/about/our-organization/raf/data/raf-project-data-archive-catalog"
     target="_top">
     Project Data Archive Catalog</a> to the dataset as a document. Unlink
 all the links to order the data. Add an order link for each data type
 that points back to codiac:
 <pre>
1) Check for taplog in xlink table in codiac. I search on project number
2) If not there, in GUImaint Xlinks tab, add it. Exit GUImaint and get back
in.
3) in GUImaint Xlinks tab add dataset_id and href linkage, post save
4) Click on project tab and add xlink to project (if not there)
5) Go to /net/www/raf/Catalog and update taplog.
- Remove mss_retrieval links.
- Add links to codiac for NetCDF and GENPRO datasets. Link to order page
6) Go to /net/www/raf/Headers. "ncdump -h" on RF01.nc for this project and
save to headerNC.<project number> for LRT data (or HeaderNC.### if HRT
data)
7) Go to RAF project table, check link to taplog and add link to new
headerNC file. 
</pre>
 Note this in DTS.
Have the DTS send me the email so I know to do final checking. 
<p>
<li> Once I have checked the dataset, add a direct link to the codiac order
page for that dataset in place of the taplog link
 that is currently in the new
 <a
     href="http://www.eol.ucar.edu/about/our-organization/raf/data/raf-project-data-archive-catalog"
     target="_top">
     Project Data Archive Catalog</a> page. These are the same links you
 are using to make the netCDF dataset a companion to the GENPRO dataset.
 <p>
 <li> Add the dataset and conversion info into <b>IVEN.</b>
<p>In the DLN select the project and click "IVEN Dataset List"
click "Add New" add the NetCDF and GENPROII dataset pair (by dataset id number)
click on the NetCDF dataset
Click add Source and put in the GENPROII dataset_id
	Set "Data Directory" to the dir you worked in
	EMDAC Platforms is the aircraft platform_id (ie the King Air is 31)
click "Add Software" Select g2n conversion scripts [aircraft name]
	Set Repository Tag Name to dir scrips are in under g2n/tags in svn (usually project name)
click the edit button to the left of the dataset name
Set contact, status, work location, and final data location
</p>
<p>
<li><b>Put the scripts into SVN.</b>
<p>To set up a new platform area (if needed):
<ol>
<li> cd to /net/work/Projects/g2n_conversion
<li>mkdir PLATFORM
<li>svn import . http://svn/svn/dmg/conversions/aircraft/PLATFORM/g2n
</ol>
</p>
<p>To add processing scripts for specific projects to that area:
<ul>
    <li>Remove unessesary data from working dir (rm -rf HRT)
    <li>mv working dir to platform directory
    <ul>cd /net/work/Projects/g2n_conversion<br/>
	mv PROJ PLATFORM</ul>
<li>cd PLATFORM
<li>svn add PROJ
<li>svn ci
</ul>
</p>

</ol>
