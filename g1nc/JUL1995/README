Explanation of files and directories
------------------------------------
Cray/           -  Directory of GENPRO-related files for SCD's Cray computers
IBM4381/        -  Various files from SCD's now-retired IBM4381 (our primary
                    GENPRO-processing computer before UNIX)
celia/          -  Directory with some of Celia Chen's old files
misc/           -  Directory having miscellaneous files and directories
                    Example:  a subdirectory with software for generating
                     triangular-weight filter coefficients for GENPRO's FILTER
projects/       -  Directory of recent and active GENPRO project-processing
                    files 
unix/           -  Directory of GENPRO-related files for UNIX machines (e.g.,
                    the Masscomp and Sun computers)

NOTE:  Copyright notices were added to *.f files (except files in the
        calib.old subdirectory) on 26 January 1993.  It may also be
        prudent to add notices to *.if, *.IF, *.F and the 'calib.old'
        files.
