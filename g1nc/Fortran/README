Notes from Dan Nagle <dnagle@ucar.edu>
April 2016

I changed fixed format to free format with Michael Metcalf's convert
program.
(Available own yellowstone after 'module load ftools')

This compiles with gfortran (GNU Fortran (GCC) 6.0.0 20160317
(experimental))

Changes to the code are marked by !dln. I believe these repairs are low-risk, but that doesn't mean I understand everything.

Please Note That I Have Not Tested This!
